CATG
----

CATG is a concolic unit testing engine for Java programs.  The implementation uses ASM for instrumentation.
ASM instrumentation instruments (see janala.instrument.*) class files at runtime and dumps (see janala.logger.*)
to a file a log of all instructions executed by the program and all values loaded from local stacks and heaps.
A concolic execution engine (see janala.interpreters.*) then takes the log and performs both symbolic and
concrete interpretation of the logged instructions.

ant build
./testall

If you are using cygwin, replace concolic by concolic.cygwin in testall.
